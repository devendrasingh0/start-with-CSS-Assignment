    The BEM naming convention is a CSS convention for naming classes in a modular and reusable way. 
    It consists of three parts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Block:The block is the main element on the page.</li>
        <li>Element:The element is a child element of the block.</li>
        <li>Modifier:The modifier is used to change the appearance of the block or element.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> the above example, the .paragraph class is the block class. The .paragraph--intro, .paragraph--body, and .paragraph--conclusion classes are modifier classes.</p>
    <p>The modifier classes are used to apply distinct styling to each paragraph. For example, the .paragraph--intro class makes the introductory paragraph bold and centered. The .paragraph--body class makes the body paragraph left-aligned. And the .paragraph--conclusion class makes the concluding paragraph right-aligned.</p>
